## Directory structure

- `/`

  The assembly files and git related stuff

- `/base/*`

  All necessary parts for the frame exluding the parts in `/flavor/*`.

- `/flavor/*`

  Remaining parts for the frame in multiple variations. Pick one depending on your needs. In the SolidWorks files it's probably a configuration.

- `/accessories/*`

  Additional stuff like GoPro Mounts.

## Compatibility

All SolidWorks files are saved with SolidWorks 2018.

Unfortunatly this frame is currently not compatible with the C-Train arms for the floss 2.1. But in the SolidWorks files you can find (pretty half-assed) configurations for compatible parts. This will change in the future, when I broke all my spare parts or demand is high enough.
