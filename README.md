## Specifications

- Wheelbase: 223mm 5"
- Baseplate: 3mm
- Arm thickness: 4-5mm
- Stackmount: 30,5mm x 30,5mm

## Directory structure

- `/`

  The assembly files and git related stuff

- `/base/*`

  All necessary parts for the frame exluding the parts in `/flavor/*`.

- `/flavor/*`

  Remaining parts for the frame in multiple variations. Pick one depending on your needs. In the SolidWorks files it's probably a configuration.

- `/accessories/*`

  Additional stuff like GoPro Mounts.

## Manufacturing

Anufacturing of this frame is a little bit more complex than most other frames, since it currently depends on carbon milling, aluminum milling and 3D printing.

### Carbon parts

- `/base/base*`
  - 3mm
- `/flavor/arm*`
  - 4-5mm

### Aluminum parts

- `/base/bracket*`

Currently i'm milling the brackets myself with an 3Axis CNC mill and drilling the remaining holes with the help of an 3D printed drill guide (Kinda a negative of the brackets). 5Axis milling would be preferable though.

### 3D printed parts

- `/base/canopy*`
- `/flavor/antennamount*`
- `/accessories/*`

All parts should pe printed in TPU. Also all parts can be printed without support structures. The `canopy` is a little bit tricky but definitely possible. When im doing the next print, I'll be updating with my print settings.

## Compatibility

All SolidWorks files are saved with SolidWorks 2018.

Unfortunatly this frame is currently not compatible with the C-Train arms for the floss 2.1. But in the SolidWorks files you can find (pretty half-assed) configurations for compatible parts. This will change in the future, when I broke all my spare parts or demand is high enough.
